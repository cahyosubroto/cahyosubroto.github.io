Key features include:</p><ul><li><strong>Protocol Mapping:</strong> Zilla can use <a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAPI</a> and <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AsyncAPI</a> definitions to be mapped to Kafka, enabling Kafka topics to be exposed over user-defined REST, SSE, MQTT, and gRPC APIs.</li><li><strong>No External Dependencies:</strong> Zilla has no external dependencies and does not rely on the Kafka Consumer/Producer API or Kafka Connect. Instead, it natively supports the Kafka wire protocol and uses novel protocol mapping techniques to establish stateless API entry points into Kafka.</li><li><strong>Security and Observability:</strong> Enforce security, provide observability, and offload connections on the data path.</li></ul><h3 id="kafka-fan-out-to-web-and-iot-data-broadcasting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kafka-fan-out-to-web-and-iot-data-broadcasting"><span>Kafka Fan-Out to Web and IoT (Data Broadcasting)</span></a></h3><p>Broadcast data from Kafka to millions of clients over SSE, MQTT, and gRPC. With Kafka and Zilla, real-time updates such as stock tickers, sports scores, logistics trackers, and push notifications can be reliably delivered to end users and systems at scale.</p><p>Kafka is not designed to support many connected clients, so besides protocol mapping, Zilla also handles connection offloading by pushing data out of a real-time cache. This local cache is synchronized with Kafka for specific topics through several connections, independent of the number of connected clients. The cache also indexes message keys and headers upon retrieval from Kafka, supporting efficiently filtered reads from cached topics.</p><h3 id="kafka-fan-in-from-web-and-iot-clickstream-and-telemetry-ingestion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#kafka-fan-in-from-web-and-iot-clickstream-and-telemetry-ingestion"><span>Kafka Fan-In from Web and IoT (Clickstream and Telemetry Ingestion)</span></a></h3><p>Ingest data into Kafka from millions of clients over HTTP, MQTT, and gRPC. With Kafka and Zilla, clickstream and telemetry data can be processed and responded to in real-time. Kafka is not designed to support many connected clients, so besides protocol mapping, Zilla also pools connections, ensuring the number of inbound connections is independent of the number of connected clients.</p><h3 id="iot-ingestion-and-control" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#iot-ingestion-and-control"><span>IoT Ingestion and Control</span></a></h3><p>Remove an MQTT broker from a Kafka-based EDA to streamline an IoT deployment. Zilla can persist MQTT messages and client states across pre-configured Kafka topics. Once these messages are in Kafka, they become readily available to Kafka clients, consumers, and stream processing pipelines.
