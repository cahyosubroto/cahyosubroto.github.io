During <code>zillabase start,</code> a Keycloak service is initialized by creating a specified realm, adding configured users, setting up client scopes, and registering a client. Update the <code>zillabase/config.yaml</code> file to modify the Keycloak configuration. Read <a href="/products/authentication/concepts">this article</a> for more information.</p></details><details class="hint-container details"><summary>If an authentication configuration is defined, is every endpoint now protected as authenticated user only?</summary><p>Yes. If an authentication configuration is defined, every endpoint will require an authenticated user to access it. This means that any request should include the bearer access token in the request authorization header.</p></details><details class="hint-container details"><summary>How do you get authenticated user information on Zillabase?</summary><p>Zilla injects the authentication information into the Kafka message header. Later, you can refer to the <code>zilla_identity</code> value in the stream or view definition to correlate an event with a user or to query something specific to the user. Read <a href="/products/authentication/obtain-user">this article</a> for more information.</p></details><details class="hint-container details"><summary>What was the difference between <code>/&lt;entity-name&gt;</code> and <code>/&lt;entity-name&gt;-stream</code> endpoints?</summary><p>The <code>/&lt;entity-name&gt;</code> endpoint is a regular REST endpoint that follows the request-response model. On the other hand, the <code>/entity-name&gt;-stream</code> endpoint is a server-sent event (SSE) HTTP endpoint that emits events every time there&#39;s a new entity or updated entity. This endpoint follows the publish-subscribe model.</p></details><details class="hint-container details"><summary>What was the difference between <code>zillabase/config.yaml</code> and <code>zilla.yaml</code>?</summary><p>The <code>zillabase/config.yaml</code> is a file generated during project initialization. You can modify the Zillabase start-up configuration with the config file, including configuring authentication, environments for UDF, etc. On the other hand, <code>Zilla.yaml</code> is a Zilla configuration file that is generated during project start-up and adjusted depending on the models you defined before in the migration files. While it is usually not required, you can configure the Zilla configuration if you need some customization.</p></details><details class="hint-container details"><summary>How do I correlate the request event with the response events?</summary><p>You can use <code>zilla_correlation_id</code> to correlate request events and response events.</p></details>',8)]))}const d=t(s,[["render",o],["__file","faqs.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/support/faqs.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"description":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Does Zillabase support database transactions?
