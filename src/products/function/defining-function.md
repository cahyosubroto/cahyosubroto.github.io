# Defining Function

Zillabase provides powerful tools for managing database migrations, including the ability to define custom functions. Users can create an empty migration file using the CLI to write PostgreSQL-like SQL that defines custom functions. These functions enable advanced data transformations and logic within the database. Backed by Risingwave, Zillabase ensures robust support for functions in a streaming database environment.

Zillabase supports SQL functions, embedded functions (functions defined in SQL), and external user-defined functions (UDF) to accommodate business logic that cannot be covered with regular SQL. Currently, we support embedded functions written in Javascript, Python, and Rust and external user-defined functions written in Java and Python.

::: info
You can refer to [this article](https://docs.risingwave.com/sql/overview) for a complete supported SQL reference.

1. Create the migration file with the following command:

```sh
# command format
# zillabase migration add <migration-name>

# example
zillabase migration add create_function

# output
# Created migration 000001__create_table.sql
```

After the command succeeds, it prints the new migration file, which you can modify to define your data models. To modify the migration files, open the `zillabase/migrations` folder and edit the corresponding migration file.

2. Create an external UDF implementation file. Create `udf.py` in `zillabase/functions/python` and copy the following function definition.

```python
from arrow_udf import udf

# udf example with int result
@udf(input_types=['INT', 'INT'], result_type='INT')
def gcd(x, y):
    while y != 0:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
```

3. Edit the migration file with the following content.

```sql
-- declare function from an external user-defined function

CREATE FUNCTION gcd(int, int) RETURNS int
LANGUAGE python AS gcd;

-- embedded function

CREATE FUNCTION gcd2(a int, b int) RETURNS int LANGUAGE python AS $$
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
$$;

-- SQL UDF
CREATE FUNCTION add(INT, INT) RETURNS int LANGUAGE sql AS $$select $1 + $2$$;
```

4. To test the query.

```sql
-- test the external UDF
select gcd(12, 4);

-- test the embedded UDF
select gcd2(12, 4);

-- test the SQL UDF
Select add(1, 2);
```
