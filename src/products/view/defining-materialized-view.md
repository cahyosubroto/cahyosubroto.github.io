# Defining Materialized View

Zillabase makes managing database migrations straightforward, including defining materialized views. The CLI allows users to generate a migration file that can be modified to include PostgreSQL-like syntax. A materialized view can consume streams, perform some transformation, and materialize it. The materialized view is always updated when new data is inserted into the stream.

1. Create the migration file with the following command:

```sh
# command format
# zillabase migration add <migration-name>

# example
zillabase migration add create_mv

# output
# Created migration 000001__create_mv.sql
```

After the command succeeds, it prints the new migration file, which you can modify to define your data models. To modify the migration files, open the `zillabase/migrations` folder and edit the corresponding migration file.

2. Edit the migration file with the following content.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW IF NOT EXISTS streampay_replies AS
    SELECT '400' AS status, encode(zilla_correlation_id, 'escape') AS correlation_id from streampay_commands where type NOT IN ('SendPayment', 'RequestPayment', 'RejectRequest')
    UNION
    SELECT '200' AS status,  encode(zilla_correlation_id, 'escape') AS correlation_id from streampay_commands where type IN ('SendPayment', 'RequestPayment', 'RejectRequest');
```
