# StreamPay AI Example

This example is an implementation of the StreamPay App designed to transfer payments from one user to another.

Zilla implements the REST endpoints defined in an AsyncAPI 3.x spec and proxies them onto Kafka topics defined in an AsyncAPI 3.x spec based on the operations specified in each spec. Both HTTP AsyncAPI 3.x spec and Kafka AsyncAPI 3.x spec are generated automatically based on the Kafka Cluster metadata information.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you fulfill the following requirements:

- Java 20+
- Homebrew package manager
- Docker
- Zillabase CLI
- NodeJS (with npm or yarn)
- [OpenAI API Key (Optional)](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Installing Zillabase CLI

If you don't have Zillabase CLI installed, install it with the following command:

```sh
brew tap aklivity/tap

brew install zillabase
```

::: info
The Homebrew package manager is required. You can install it on MacOS and other Linux distributions. To install it, run the following command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

:::

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the Zillabase repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aklivity/zillabase.git
```

The StreamPay project is stored in the `examples/streampay` directory.

2. go to the `streampay` project example directory on the cloned repository directory.

```sh
cd examples/streampay
```

3. To enable the OpenAI fraud detection integration, you must use an `OPENAI_API_KEY` and add it to the `zillabase/config.yaml` file.

```yaml
udf:
  python:
    env:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=<your OpenAI API key>
```

4. Start the Zillabase project and wait for the initialization process to finish.

```sh
zillabase start
```

Output:

```text
latest: Pulling from aklivity/zillabase
...
seed.sql processed successfully!
...
Realm: zillabase created successfully.
...
Config Server is populated with zilla.yaml
```

5. Next, we'll set up the StreamPay UI. Install the dependencies with the following command:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

6. Install quasar globally with the following command:

```sh
npm install -g @quasar/cli
```

::: info
You might need to execute `rehash` to find `quasar` on the path after installing quasar.
:::

7. Start the frontend application in development mode.

```sh
quasar dev
```

## StreamPay APIs

The Zillabase Streampay exposes common entity CRUD endpoints, with the entity data stored on Kafka topics if Kafka's `cleanup.policy=compact` is set; otherwise, it exposes only Read mode endpoints.

Zillabase leverages the AsyncAPI schema definitions to define all of the generated streaming APIs. You can export the generated API schema definition by running this Zillabase command:

```bash
zillabase asyncapi show http-asyncapi >> asyncapi_REST_APIs.yaml
```

Once the generated AsyncAPI schema is exported, you can copy it into the [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/) to get a complete picture of all the streaming APIs you have created.

Some endpoints described are:

| Method | Endpoint                           | Topic                          | Description                                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /streampay_users                   | dev.streampay_users            | Create an user.                              |
| PUT    | /streampay_users/\{id}              | dev.streampay_users            | Update user by the key.                      |
| GET    | /streampay_users                   | dev.streampay_users            | Fetch all users.                             |
| GET    | /streampay_users/\{id}              | dev.streampay_users            | Fetch user by the key.                       |
| GET    | /streampay_balances-stream         | dev.streampay_balances         | Stream latest user's balance.                |
| POST   | /streampay_commands                | dev.streampay_commands         | Post command such as payment request or pay. |
| GET    | /streampay_payment_requests        | dev.streampay_payment_requests | Fetch all payment requests.                  |
| GET    | /streampay_payment_requests/\{id}   | dev.streampay_payment_requests | Fetch payment request by key.                |
| GET    | /streampay_payment_requests-stream | dev.streampay_payment_requests | Stream new available payment request.        |
| GET    | /streampay_activities-stream       | dev.streampay_activities       | Stream all the activities.                   |

## Using the Project

### Login

Login using Keycloak with one of the users pre-created in `zillabase/config.yaml`.

```yaml
keycloak:
  realm: zillabase
  users:
  - username: allen
    email: allen.doe@example.com
    name: Allen Doe
    password: Test@123
```

You can log in from a different browser session to one of the other users to see how money is sent between them.

### Send Money

Once logged in, users should have a starting balance of money. You can:

- `SEND OR REQUEST` funds to any of the other users. Ideally, you can send or request to a second User you are logged in as.
- `Sending` money will immediately move money to the other user.
- `Requesting` money will send a transaction request to that user.

### Transfer Requests

A user with a transfer request can `Approve` or `Reject` the request. You can:

- `Approve` the payment. The money will be transferred to the requesting user.
- `Reject` the payment. The request will be removed from the list and marked as rejected.
- Wait for the OpenAI fraud check to finish to determine the potential fraud risk.

## OpenAI Fraud Risk with Zillabase

By leveraging the existing CQRS event stream that the Streampay app uses in Zillabase, we can create OpenAI query functions using the Python OpenAI library.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    UI->>Zillabase: User creates a payment request
    Zillabase->>UI: Both users are notified a request is created with PENDING fraud risk
    Zillabase->>OpenAI: OpenAI is queried to determine fraud risk
    OpenAI->>Zillabase: Capture fraud risk
    Zillabase->>UI: Show the requested user the fraud risk as LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk
    UI->>Zillabase: Accept risk and transfer
    Zillabase->>OpenAI: Record decision as safe and use OpenAI to calculate embeddings
    UI->>Zillabase: Reject risk and block
    Zillabase->>OpenAI: Record decision as risky and use OpenAI to calculate embeddings
```

When a new transaction request from Allen to transfer $3400 to Bertollo is created, the OpenAI query will be something similar to the following:

```text
==== Open AI Query ====

Use the below collection of safe and risky money transfer requests to answer the subsequent question and your opinion.

Collection:
"""
Allen transferring $3200 to Bertollo is risky
Allen transferring $3400 to Fred is safe
Allen transferring $3900 to Greg is safe
Allen transferring $2800 to Candice is safe
Elaine transferring $4300 to Bertollo is safe
"""

Question: Should Allen transfer $3400 to Bertollo?

==== Open AI Result ====

{
 "summary": "Based on the previous data, Allen transferring money to Bertollo has been identified as risky in one instance. Although Allen has made safe transfers to others, the specific transfer to Bertollo raises concerns. Therefore, it is advisable to consider the risk before proceeding.",
 "risk": "MEDIUM"
}
```

This system prompt is used:

```text
You recommend the amount of fraud risk for money transfers between two people and respond only with a JSON object containing your summary and a numeric value of the risk as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. Only return valid JSON string and no other markup.
```

You can find the Python functions used in the `zillabase/functions/python/fraud_check.py` file.

## Stopping the Project

Close the Quasar development server (Ctrl+C), then stop the Zillabase project.

```bash
zillabase stop
```
